## Freenet

23 years ago we created Freenet, which was the first distributed, decentralized peer-to-peer network, and a pioneer of technologies like cryptographic contracts and small-world networks.

Today we're building Locutus, which will make it easy for developers to create decentralized alternatives to today's centralized tech companies. These decentralized apps will be easy to use, scalable, and secured through cryptography.

## Software
